## Part 2

Most frequent problems to be found at diagnostics stage:
1. Tableau generates a distinct query for each filter you have on a dashboard,
2. Tableau executes queries sequentially (if there are too many – then it shows in performance),
3. T. generates ugly joins
4. T. generates bad type conversions (i.e. turn everything nvarchar (9000),
5. LOD’s normally show up very poor in the code
6. WHERE predicates are far too complex and non-sargable,
7. Some formulas yield code like “CASE WHEN 1=0 THEN …. ELSE … END”,
