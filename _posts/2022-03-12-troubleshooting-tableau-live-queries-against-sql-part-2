## Troubleshooting performance of tableau live connections to SQL Server - part 1. BASICS.

👋 Hello everyone, wish you enjoy reading these findings I've gathered over a couple of years working with this type of scenario
This is part 2 where we discuss specific symptoms and troubleshooting steps

### Not obvious stuff done by Tableau under-the-hood

Here is a list of things that Tableau does to retrieve data for you - specifically the things that make your SQL Server yield suboptimal performance.

1. Tableau generates a distinct query for each filter you have on a dashboard,
2. Tableau executes queries sequentially (if there are too many – then it shows in performance),
3. T. generates ugly joins
4. T. generates bad type conversions (i.e. turn everything nvarchar (9000),
5. LOD’s normally show up very poor in the code
6. WHERE predicates are far too complex and non-sargable,
7. Some formulas yield code like “CASE WHEN 1=0 THEN …. ELSE … END”,
